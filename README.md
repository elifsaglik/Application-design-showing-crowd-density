# Application-design-showing-crowd-density
The design of the application got 3rd place in the Unichallenge  Tech Competition. The design is solely done by Elif Saglik and copying and distribution is prohibited. The sole purpose of the application is to allow fearless travel to public places under the guidelines defined for the pandemic. By using this sensors  we can track the live crowd density and send the data back to the application, hence can see the occupancy rates. Also the application provides the feature of online menus of the restaurants,cafes and bars through which we can minimize the touch in public places.
